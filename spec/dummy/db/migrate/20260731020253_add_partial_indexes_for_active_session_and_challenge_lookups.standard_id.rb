  # Run indexes CONCURRENTLY on Postgres so we don't take a long write lock on
  # busy tables. SQLite (dummy app, some host setups) ignores algorithm:; we
  # only pass :concurrently when the adapter is Postgres.
  #
  # StrongMigrations note: every change here is additive and non-destructive
  # except for the GIN drop in step 3. We guard that drop with an `if_exists`
  # check so StrongMigrations/host apps that never ran the creating migration
  # (e.g. SQLite dummies) don't error. StrongMigrations considers partial-
  # index-add and remove_index safe when concurrently + if_exists are used, so
  # no ignore comment is needed.
  #
  # Split into def up / def down because `remove_index :table, name: "..."`
  # (name-only, no column list) is not auto-reversible via def change — Rails
  # raises ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration on rollback. The explicit down
  # path re-adds the GIN index using the same column + opclass the creating
  # migration used (t.index :metadata, using: :gin).

    # partial index on expires_at WHERE revoked_at IS NULL is both smaller
    # and lets Postgres short-circuit the revoked_at check in the plan.
